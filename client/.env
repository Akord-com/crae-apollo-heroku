# This file contains the ENV vars necessary to run the app locally using the
# 'heroku local' command.
# IMPORTANT: DO NOT store sensitive data here.
# Use 'heroku config:set' command to define your environment variables in your
# production or staging environment. For instance, you can run the following
# command to set your graphql endpoint for an app that is deployed to heroku:
# heroku config:set REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URI=https://app-name.herokuapp.com/graphql
# Then you will need to force heroku to rebuild the app so that the recently set
# env var can be embedded during the next build of your Create React App (CRA).
# Remember, CRA produces a static HTML/CSS/JS bundle, so it canâ€™t read env vars
# at runtime!
# For more information see this: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables

REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URI=http://localhost:5000/graphql
